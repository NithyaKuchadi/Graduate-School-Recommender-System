# Graduate-School-Recommender-System
As competition for admission into higher education increases, it becomes even more important for applicants to find graduate schools that fit their requirements and expectation. Selecting appropriate schools to apply, however, is a time-consuming process, especially when looking for schools at graduate level due to the various factors in decision making imposed by the schools and applicants. This problem can be addressed by developing a recommender system for graduate admission seekers which can help them to choose graduate school matching their academic profile. 

Implemented 2 models.
1. K Nearest Neighbors
